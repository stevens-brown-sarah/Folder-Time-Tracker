# Folder-Time-Tracker
This tracks how long on average it took to review each person's folders, as well as providing a monthly visualisation to track changes over time. Lovely opportunity for me to work with dynamic cell ranges for the visualisations!

Enter the data logging the start time and end time. The length of time will automatically appear in the blue column, and the visualisations will automatically update. 

If a folder is reviewed in two stages, each stage can be logged separately and this will be accounted for automatically.
